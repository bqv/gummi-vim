\section{Before you start}

You are now using Gummi 0.6.0. Many new features have been added to this release. As you can see, this editor is now held in a tab. You can open new tabs by using the New function or opening an existing file. Using the Project menu, you can add documents to a master file. 

Support for two high-level LaTeX building systems, rubber (url) \& latexmk (url) has been added to this release as well. You can select your preferred typesetter on the Compilation tab of the Preferences menu. If you do not have these programs installed, they won't be selectable. 

Added for your viewing convenience is a continous preview mode for the PDF. This mode is enabled by default, but can also be disabled through the \emph{(View$\rightarrow$Page layout in preview)} menu. 

\section{Feedback}

\section{One more thing}
If you are wondering where your old default text is, it has been stored as a template. Use the File menu to access and restore it.
