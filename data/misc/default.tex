\section{Before you start}

You are now using Gummi 0.6.0. Many new features have been added to this release. The editor is now held in a tab. New or opened documents will create a new tab that can be edited simultaneously with all your other documents. Several files can be grouped together using the Projects menu. 

Support for two high-level {\LaTeX} building systems, \emph{rubber}\footnote{https://launchpad.net/rubber/} \& \emph{latexmk}\footnote{http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/} has been added to this release as well. Your preferred typesetter can be configured through the Compilation tab in the Preferences menu. Typesetters that are not installed on your system will not be selectable. 

Added for your viewing convenience is a continuous preview mode for the PDF. This mode is enabled by default, but can also be disabled through the \emph{(View $\rightarrow$ Page layout in preview)} menu. 

\section{Feedback}
We hope you will enjoy using this release as much as we enjoyed creating it. If you have comments, suggestions or wish to report an issue you are experiencing - contact us at: \emph{http://gummi.midnightcoding.org}.

\section{One more thing}
If you are wondering where your old default text is; it has been stored as a template. The template menu can be used to access and restore it.
