Vanilla installation

Following are a few instructions for doing an installation of Gummi on your system using the vanilla tarball. 
I would advise using the packages I provide above this installation method, but at this moment only Gentoo, 
Ubuntu and Fedora packages are available.

Gummi's dependencies can be divided into three categories. Unfortunately some of the names may vary due to the 
tendency of some distributions to rename packages to conform to their naming policies. 

Gnome/Python dependencies:

    * python-2.4 or higher
    * gtk+-2.16 or higher
    * pango 

Editor/LateX dependencies:

    * python-gtksourceview-2.40 or higher (python bindings for sourceview2 widget.)
    * texlive-latex-(base/bin)
    * texlive-latex-extra 

Poppler dependencies:

    * python-poppler-0.10.0 or higher (python bindings for poppler, aka pypoppler.) 

After sorting out the dependencies, you are ready to install the Gummi tarball. I included a distutils script with 
the package that will make things easier. The following code shows the three steps of installation from a root console:

1) retrieving the tarball:

Please visit the website (gummi.midnightcoding.org) to retrieve lastest tarball

2) unpacking the archive:

tar -xvf gummi-0.2f.tar.gz

3) running the setup script to install the python modules:

cd gummi0.1f
python setup.py install

If all went well, Gummi is now succesfully installed on your system. Try running the "gummi" command from the command 
line. If you missed one of the dependencies, python will return an import error in most cases.
